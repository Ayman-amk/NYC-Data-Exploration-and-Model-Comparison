# Exploratory Data Analysis and Classification Model Comparison

## Project Title: NYC Data Analysis and Classification

### Overview:

This repository contains Python code for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a NYC dataset, followed by a comparison of various classification models. The analysis includes statistical summaries, visualization of key features, correlation matrices, factor analysis, chi-square tests, handling missing data, and identifying outliers. The final section evaluates the performance of multiple classification models using metrics such as accuracy, AUC, recall, precision, F1 score, Kappa, and MCC.
